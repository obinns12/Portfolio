This Portfolio is a compilation of all the Data Analysis projects I have done for academic, self-learning and other purposes. I build clear, data-driven stories using code, analytics, and compelling visualizations. My projects focus on transforming raw data into insights through R, SQL, and Tableau.

Project 1 (Leaflet Introductory Code):
This R script uses the leaflet package to create interactive maps by first displaying a basic map of the United States, then plotting several major cities using their latitude and longitude coordinates. It adds standard markers for most cities but highlights Philadelphia with a custom red heart icon to distinguish it from the others. Overall, the code demonstrates how to build a map, add location-based data, incorporate clickable popups, and customize specific markers for clearer visual emphasis.

Project 2 (Walkable areas in Pennsylvania):
This R script loads and cleans Excel data, imports a Pennsylvania block-group shapefile, and joins the two datasets using a standardized GEOID field. After transforming the spatial data to a web-mapping coordinate system, it selects the top five records and calculates their geographic centroids. It then creates a clean, interactive leaflet map using a light basemap and places pink circle markers at each centroid, with popups displaying the corresponding GEOID values.

Project 3 (Data Cleaning Practice): https://github.com/obinns12/Portfolio/blob/5549bc68e7bf542c182b6730f58b78b48c5ecb3f/Data%20Cleaning%20Practice
This script loads a raw subscription-customer dataset, cleans and standardizes it, and prepares a final deduplicated version for analysis. It begins by importing the data and cleaning column names, then explores key fields and identifies duplicate customer IDs. Next, it normalizes text fields such as plan type and region by fixing inconsistent capitalization, trimming whitespace, and correcting typos. The code then handles data quality issues by setting unrealistic ages and monthly spending values to missing, counting NA values, dropping rows with missing plan types, and imputing missing numeric fields with their median values. Finally, it removes duplicate customer records, resulting in a clean, consistent, and analysis-ready dataset.

Project 4 (Logistic Regression on Grad School Data):
This R script loads a dataset of graduate admissions (with variables like GRE, GPA, school rank, and admission outcome), does exploratory data analysis (summary statistics, standard deviations), and then builds a logistic regression model to predict admission (binary outcome) using GRE, GPA, and rank. It converts “rank” to a categorical factor, fits a logistic (binomial) model, and then calculates odds ratios by exponentiating the model coefficients. It assesses model fit using McFadden's R-squared and pseudo-R² via a package for model evaluation. Then it computes predicted admission probabilities for each applicant, inspects the percentage change in odds, and builds classification rules using different probability cutoffs (0.5, 0.4), producing confusion matrices. Lastly, the script evaluates model performance more thoroughly by constructing a ROC curve, computing sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy across thresholds, and uses pROC to identify an optimal cutoff for admissions.

Project 5 (Marathon Analytics):
This project analyzes marathon performance using multiple statistical methods to understand what factors influence marathon time, whether injury and footwear interact to affect performance, and whether gender can be predicted from training and demographic variables. A multiple linear regression model examined age, gender, BMI, weekly mileage, peak mileage, marathon fitness, footwear, and injury to identify which variables most strongly impact marathon time. A two-way ANOVA tested the interaction between injury and footwear to determine whether their combination significantly affects race time. Finally, a logistic regression model predicted gender using age, marathon time, weekly mileage, and peak mileage, producing a probability-based classification rule along with sensitivity, specificity, and odds-ratio interpretations. Overall, the analysis provides insights into performance determinants, equipment and injury effects, and demographic prediction within marathon runners.
